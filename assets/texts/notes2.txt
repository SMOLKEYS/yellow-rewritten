By downloading Yellow, you allow me to give you the information that:

- This is NOT a finished project, and will stay that way for a long time.
- There is NO campaign content NOR any storyline content. Those will not be added for a long time. Storyline work can take a while.
- Crashes, even if rare, will occur. Feel free reporting them. But {slow}{shake}BY GOD{reset} please check if the issue you had was already reported.

That is all I have to say. Enjoy the mess!
