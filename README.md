Starting all over again. Time to see if this can work in my favor.

Head over to [here](https://discord.gg/uAddT46bFx) for updates.

> Will old content be here?

Yes. Everything made back in the old repository will be ported over, but with some changes and fixes I've entirely forgotten to address.

Buffs, nerfs, bugfixes, expect a lot to happen in the upcoming days.

> What will happen to future content that was supposed to be made?

Those will still be made. I just chose to redo everything else to get a tidier codebase and a better grip on what the hell I'm doing in general.

Plus, I get to start back at `v0`, giving me a *lot* of room again to work on stuff I'd like to release bit by bit.

> How BAD was the original codebase?

- Me using utility functions I made, not realizing Arc/Mindustry already has those
- One thing breaking the other, and vice versa
- A scuffed amalgamation of Java and Kotlin

In short, VERY bad.

> How did the idea of making a campaign AND storyline update for THIS mod of all things even come to be?

I don't know. Probably the hundreds of stories I've read sparked something within me.
